# Data repository

This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the article

> Unsupervised machine learning shock capturing for High-Order CFD solvers

The instructions to compute the simulations of sections VI A and VI B are in `simulations/`,
and `scripts/` contains scripts to generate the Cp plot of section VI B, and the results of
sections VI C and VI D.
In the folder `figures/` we include the figures that appear in the article.

The simulations are performed using the open-source software HORSES3D.
Specifically the branch
[research/2023_andres_gmm](https://github.com/loganoz/horses3d/tree/research/2023_andres_gmm).
