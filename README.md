This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the article

> An unsupervised machine-learning-based shock sensor: application to high-order supersonic flow solvers

The instructions to compute the simulations of sections 6.1 to 6.4, and appendix C are in
`simulations/`. `scripts/` contains programs to generate the Cp plot of section 6.4, and the
results of sections 6.5 and 6.6. In `figures/` we include the images that appear in the article.

The simulations are performed using the open-source software HORSES3D.
Specifically the branch
[research/2023_andres_gmm](https://github.com/loganoz/horses3d/tree/research/2023_andres_gmm).
