[![arxiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2308.00086-red?style=flat-square&logo=arxiv)](https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2308.00086)

This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the article

> An unsupervised machine-learning-based shock sensor for high-order supersonic flow solvers

The instructions to compute the simulations of sections VI A, B, C and D, and appendix C are in
`simulations/`. `scripts/` contains programs to generate the Cp plot of section VI D, and the
results of sections VI E and VI F. In `figures/` we include the images that appear in the article.

The simulations are performed using the open-source software HORSES3D.
Specifically the branch
[research/2023_andres_gmm](https://github.com/loganoz/horses3d/tree/research/2023_andres_gmm).
