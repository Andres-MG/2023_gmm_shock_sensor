This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the article

> An unsupervised machine-learning-based shock sensor for high-order supersonic flow solvers

The instructions to compute the simulations of sections VI A, B, C and D are in `simulations/`,
and `scripts/` contains scripts to generate the Cp plot of section VI D, and the results of
sections VI E and VI F.
In the folder `figures/` we include the figures that appear in the article.

The simulations are performed using the open-source software HORSES3D.
Specifically the branch
[research/2023_andres_gmm](https://github.com/loganoz/horses3d/tree/research/2023_andres_gmm).
